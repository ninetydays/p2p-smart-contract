# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn hardhat help
yarn test
REPORT_GAS=true yarn test
yarn start
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
